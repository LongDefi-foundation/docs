# Smart Contracts

## Overview

LongDefi smart contracts build on ERC4337 concept. There are 3 main contracts: `SmartAccountV1Factory`, `SmartAccountV1` and `Authorizer`.

### SmartAccountV1Factory

> [SmartAccountV1Factory Source Code](https://github.com/LongDefi-foundation/core-contracts/blob/main/src/SmartAccountV1Factory.sol)

The factory contract is used to create new smart wallets. It is a minimal proxy contract that deploys a new `SmartAccountV1` contract and initializes it with the owner's address.

### SmartAccountV1

> [SmartAccountV1 Source Code](https://github.com/LongDefi-foundation/core-contracts/blob/main/src/SmartAccountV1.sol)

The smart wallet contract is a proxy contract that acts as a proxy for the user's account, allowing them to place orders and manage their assets without giving up control of their private keys.

### Authorizer

> [Authorizer Source Code](https://github.com/LongDefi-foundation/core-contracts/blob/main/src/Authorizer.sol)

The authorizer contract is used to validate the multi-factor signatures of an order in LongDefi. Check [smart wallet security](./how-it-works#multi-factor-validation) section for more details.
