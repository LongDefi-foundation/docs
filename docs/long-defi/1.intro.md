# Long Defi

## What is the problem?

Memecoin is gaining more attention, but its price fluctuates wildly and it is mostly traded on DEX.

DEX is easy to use, which is nice, but they also have some disadvantages. Particularly, they do not offer risk management tools such as take profit and stop loss, which are essential to optimize your portfolio investment. Moreover, you have to sign a transaction for every trade, which is inconvenient.

## Why Long Defi?

Trade meme coins with ease and peace of mind with LongDefi, a smart wallet that supports stop orders on any DEX platform. This unique feature, inspired by Account Abstraction - ERC433712, allows you to control your risk and reward in the volatile meme coin market. LongDefi is designed to improve your trading experience and safety.
