3. Visit https://sepoliafaucet.com and claim a test token.

4. Visit https://longdefi.io and click "Connect Wallet" in the top right corner.

5. Click "Create Smart Wallet".

:::tip Session key

We know that it's so inconvenient to sign every order. So when you log in to smart account we will create a session key to enhance your experience. Session key is a temporary key that is used to sign orders.

Now you can create orders with your Smart Wallet! Let's do that next.

## Create Orders

1. Before creating an order, you need to deposit some tokens into your Smart Wallet. Click "Deposit" and choose the token you want to deposit.

2. Choose your desired token pair.

3. Set the amount and price you want the order to be triggered.

4. Click "Create Order".

5. Now you can go to sleep and don't worry about rug pulls. :star_struck:
